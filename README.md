# SDM-lab-2
## Description
This program defines a class List with methods for appending, inserting, deleting, and manipulating a linked list.
### First implementation
In this implementation, a program was made for working with a list based on built-in arrays.
### Second implementation
In this implementation, a program was made to work with a one-way linked circular list.
## Variant
Number of my gradebook is 1226, and the remainder of division by 4 is 2 - my variant.
1) [list based on built-in arrays](https://github.com/YanPetrov7/SDM-lab-2/tree/766513f9e4d50dc3be0c84e3ec3eb18e1a2313ff).
2) [one-way linked circular list](https://github.com/YanPetrov7/SDM-lab-2).
## How to launch the application:
### 1) [Install](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/) Node.js on your system if it's not already installed.
### 2) Clone the repository to your local machine:

## Conclusion
Unit tests can be extremely helpful in ensuring that code behaves as expected and continues to do so as changes are made. They can catch errors early in the development process and help developers to build more robust and reliable software. However, writing and maintaining unit tests can also be time-consuming, so it's important to strike a balance and prioritize testing efforts based on the needs of the project.
